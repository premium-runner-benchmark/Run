# Contributing to H5P-Nodejs-Library

Welcome and thank you for your interest in contributing to H5P-Nodejs-Library, we really appreciate it.
Lumi tries to improve education wherever it is possible by providing a software that connects teachers with their students. Every help is appreciated and welcome.

There are many ways to contribute:

-   reporting bugs
-   feature suggestions
-   fixing bugs
-   submitting pull requests for enhancements

## Reporting Bugs, Asking Questions, Sending Suggestions

Just file a GitHub issue, that‚Äôs all. If you want to prefix the title with a ‚ÄúQuestion:‚Äù, ‚ÄúBug:‚Äù, or the general area of the application, that would be helpful, but it is by no means mandatory. If you have write access, add the appropriate labels.

If you‚Äôre filing a bug, specific steps to reproduce are helpful. Please include the URL of the page that has the bug, along with what you expected to see and what happened instead.

## Pull Requests

### Code Reviews

Code reviews are an important part of our workflow. They help to keep code quality consistent, and they help every person learn and improve over time. We want to make you the best contributor you can be.

Every PR should be reviewed and approved by someone other than the author, even if the author has write access. Fresh eyes can find problems that can hide in the open if you‚Äôve been working on the code for a while.

The recommended way of finding an appropriate person to review your code is by [blaming](https://help.github.com/articles/using-git-blame-to-trace-changes-in-a-file/) one of the files you are updating and looking at who was responsible for previous commits on that file.

Then, you may ask that person to review your code by mentioning their GitHub username on the PR comments like this:

```
 cc @username
```

_Everyone_ is encouraged to review PRs and add feedback and ask questions, even people who are new. Also, don‚Äôt just review PRs about what you‚Äôre working on. Reading other people‚Äôs code is a great way to learn new techniques, and seeing code outside of your own feature helps you to see patterns across the project. It‚Äôs also helpful to see the feedback other contributors are getting on their PRs.

### Lifecycle of a Pull Request

When you‚Äôre first starting out, your natural instinct when creating a new feature will be to create a local feature branch, and start building away. If you start doing this, _stop_, take your hands off the keyboard, grab a coffee and read on. :)

**It‚Äôs important to break your feature down into small pieces first**, each piece should become its own pull request. Even if after finishing the first piece your feature isn‚Äôt functional, that is okay, we love merging unfinished code early and often.

Once you know what the first small piece of your feature will be, follow this general process while working:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project and create a new branch, using [the branch naming scheme](../docs/git-workflow.md#branch-naming-scheme), _e.g._ `add/video-preview` or `fix/1337-language-too-geeky`.
2. Make your first commit: any will do even if empty or trivial, but we need something in order to create the initial pull request. [Create the pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).
    - Write a detailed description of the problem you are solving, the part it affects, and how you plan on going about solving it.
    - If you have write access, add the **<span class="label status-in-progress">[Status] In Progress</span>** label or wait until somebody adds it. This indicates that the pull request isn‚Äôt ready for a review and may still be incomplete. On the other hand, it welcomes early feedback and encourages collaboration during the development process.
3. Start developing and pushing out commits to your new branch.
    - You can use a branch prefix like `add/`, `update/`, `try/` or `fix/` that represents the type of work you're doing.
    - Push your changes out frequently and try to avoid getting stuck in a long-running branch or a merge nightmare. Smaller changes are much easier to review and to deal with potential conflicts.
    - Run all tests before pushing. This ensures that your code follows the style guidelines and doesn‚Äôt accidentally introduce any errors or regressions.
    - Don‚Äôt be afraid to change, [squash](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html), and rearrange commits or to force push - `git push -f origin fix/something-broken`. Keep in mind, however, that if other people are committing on the same branch then you can mess up their history. You are perfectly safe if you are the only one pushing commits to that branch.
    - Squash minor commits such as typo fixes or [fixes to previous commits](http://fle.github.io/git-tip-keep-your-branch-clean-with-fixup-and-autosquash.html) in the pull request.
4. If you end up needing more than a few commits, consider splitting the pull request into separate components. Discuss in the new pull request and in the comments why the branch was broken apart and any changes that may have taken place that necessitated the split. Our goal is to catch early in the review process those pull requests that attempt to do too much.
5. When you feel that you are ready for a formal review or for merging into `master` make sure you check this list:
    - Make sure your branch merges cleanly and consider rebasing against `master` to keep the branch history short and clean.
    - Add unit tests, or at a minimum, provide helpful instructions for the reviewer so they can test your changes. This will help speed up the review process.
    - Ensure that your commit messages are [meaningful](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message).
6. Mention that the PR is ready for review or if you have write access remove the **<span class="label status-in-progress">[Status] In Progress</span>** label from the pull request and add the **<span class="label status-needs-review">[Status] Needs Review</span>** label - someone will provide feedback on the latest unreviewed changes. The reviewer will also mark the pull request as **<span class="label status-needs-author-reply">[Status] Needs Author Reply</span>** if they think you need to change anything.
7. If you get a üëç and the status has been changed to **<span class="label status-ready-to-merge">[Status] Ready to Merge</span>** ‚Äì this is great ‚Äì the pull request is ready to be merged into `master`.

Whether somebody is reviewing your code or you are reviewing somebody else‚Äôs code, [a positive mindset towards code reviews](https://medium.com/medium-eng/the-code-review-mindset-3280a4af0a89) helps a ton. We‚Äôre building something together that is greater than the sum of its parts.

If you feel yourself waiting for someone to review a PR, don‚Äôt hesitate to personally ask for someone to review it or to mention them on GitHub. _The PR author is responsible for pushing the change through._

### Commit-Messages

Please make sure to use [conventional commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

1. **fix**: a commit of the _type_ `fix` patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with `PATCH` in semantic versioning).

2. **feat**: a commit of the _type_ `feat` introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with `MINOR` in semantic versioning).

3. **BREAKING CHANGE**: a commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE`:, or appends a `!` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with `MAJOR` in semantic versioning). A `BREAKING CHANGE` can be part of commits of any type.

4. types other than `fix`: and `feat`: are allowed, for example: `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, and others.

5. footers other than `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.

### Short Branches: Merge Early and Often

In order to avoid lots of conflicts, to make sure the code works together, and to make the code review process easier, we strongly encourage that branches are small and short-lived. A branch that only has one small commit is perfectly fine and normal.

### Keeping Your Branch Up To Date

While it is tempting to merge from `master` into your branch frequently, this leads to a messy history because each merge creates a merge commit. When working by yourself, it is best to use `git pull --rebase master`, but if you're pushing to a shared repo, it is best to not do any merging or rebasing until the feature is ready for final testing, and then do a [rebase](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/How-to-Rebase-a-Pull-Request) at the very end. This is one reason why it is important to open pull requests whenever you have working code.

If you have a Pull Request branch that cannot be merged into `master` due to a conflict (this can happen for long-running Pull Request discussions), it's still best to rebase the branch (rather than merge) and resolve any conflicts on your local copy.

Once you have resolved any conflicts locally you can update the Pull Request with `git push --force-with-lease` (note: we prefer using `--force-with-lease` over `--force` to help protect remote commits).

**Be aware** that a force-push will still **replace** (overwrite) any commits currently in your shared branch, so anyone who is also using that branch will be in trouble. Only use `git push --force-with-lease` if the Pull Request is ready to merge and no one else is using it (or if you have coordinated the force-push with the other developers working on the branch).
